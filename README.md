# Smolbot
Standalone discord bot I built over the last summer for a friend's discord channel.

Everything is open-sourced (except for the hardcoded bot token and channel ids).  Feel free to use this as a template for your projects.
This runs using Discord.js's documentation for backend Javascript.  To use it, you need to install Node.js, download the dependencies needed for the project (), and run the file typing node main.js in your terminal.
